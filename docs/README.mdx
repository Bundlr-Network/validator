# Validator

Validators in Bundlr's Network monitor a single Bundlr node and validates transactions received by it. If a Bundlr does not comply with the newtork (i.e send a transaction later than its promised block), its the validator job to spot, notify other validators, and vote slash for this Bundlr Node stake.

## States
Each validator can have three states:

### Validating
When in this state, it will:
- Query all recent transactions from a single Bundlr Node.
- Check if they signature matches and if they are included in Arweave by expected block.
- If one transaction is expired, it will report to other validators and initiate a voting to slash its Node stake.
- Gossip received transactions to other validators from same Bundlr Node.
- Repeat until end of epoch


### Leading
There can only be one Leader in the network. When in this state, the validator will:
- Receive signed transactions from other validators
- Aggregate transaction receipts
- Generate a chain report by the end of epoch

### Idle
If a validator is not selected to validate in that epoch, it will remain idle and outside of the network.
